MouseGesture
============

Mouse is a more convenient tool for users to interact with PC than keyboard unless you are a professional guy who has been used to keyboard shortcut.

MouseGesture is system wide tool. I use a Global-Hook to implement it. Also I want it to be platform-crossed if it could be.

May this little tool could make your operation more efficient.

Now it support four basic directions recognization: left, up, right, down. And also several letter recognization:
a, b, c, e, g, n, etc.

What I want is that we could use mouse to perform more fluently and friendly to interact with PC without a touch-screen.

Maybe you have other good idea to improve user experience, And I appreciate you tell me :)
